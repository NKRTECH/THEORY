//JSX was created as an extension to ECMAScript with the purpose of designing a more concise and easy-to-understand syntax
//for building DOM tree structures and attributes. 
//With JSX, it is easy to define UI components in React. 
//JSX should not be implemented directly by browsers, but instead requires a compiler to transform it into ECMAScript.
