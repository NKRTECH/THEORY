// Hooks allow function components to have access to state and other React features. Because of this, class components are generally no longer needed.

// What is a Hook?
// Hooks allow us to "hook" into React features such as state and lifecycle methods.
// State generally refers to application data or properties that need to be tracked.

// Hook Rules
// There are 3 rules for hooks:

// Hooks can only be called inside React function components.
// Hooks can only be called at the top level of a component.
// Hooks cannot be conditional

// You must import Hooks from react.
